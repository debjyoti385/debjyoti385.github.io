infection have been reported across the country in 2013 H1N1 influenza assumed epidemic proportions in 2009 killing as many as 981 people and infecting 27 236 In 2010 the deaths went up to 1 763 while the number of cases remained around 20 000 In 2011 and 2012 603 and 5 044 persons respectively were diagnosed positive for the disease and total 480 deaths were reported The increase in cases is a matter of concern We have directed all hospitals to stay alert and follow the H1N1 protocol which was laid down by the ministry in 2009 In Rajasthan which has seen the maximum deaths this year special teams have been sent to assist health institutions to implement the H1N1 treatment protocol and also look into the possible factors behind this spurt said Dr Jagdish Prasad the Director General of Health Services DGHS He added that H1N1 influenza is treatable with Tamiflu which is available in all designated hospitals so there should not be any panic Preventive vaccines are available but may be in short supply because of low incidence of the disease in the past two years According to Randeep Guleria professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS H1N1 influenza affects adults and those at extremes of age The classical flu is more common in people with less immunity like the elderly people and children But this virus has been found to cause illness in young and middle aged people who are healthy said Guleria He added that the disease though self limiting in nature has been seen to cause severe symptoms if it reaches the lower respiratory organs If somebody has difficulty breathing or blood in the cough he or she must immediately visit a doctor Guleria said One should avoid spitting in public maintain good hygiene and try to avoid contact with affected individuals said Dr B D Athani medical superintendent of Safdarjung hospital According Dr Navin Dang senior microbiologist and director of Dr Dang s Lab H1N1 cases are likely to decrease with a rise in temperature South Indian states have not reported too many cases this year", "dateTime": "Feb 8, 2013, 12.44AM IST"}'],

multilevel underground parking lots at Hauz Khas and Parade Ground were touted as the erstwhile MCD s biggest achievements by the ruling BJP Both were inaugurated in February 2012 just before the municipal elections with a promise to make them operational in a month However almost a year has passed and the parking lots are yet to be opened for public use The civic agencies claim that both are almost complete However not many people are ready to believe them This has been their standard reply for the past one year If it is almost complete why don t they make it operational There is no place to park in this area and I m always worried about the safety of my vehicle questions Rajesh Kumar a businessman who visits Chandni Chowk at least four five times in a month var adSkipCounter 0 During its previous tenure BJP had sanctioned 41 parking projects of which only these two were inaugurated but none is ready even after MCD spending Rs 80 90 crore At both facilities 2 5 of civil work is pending which the South and North corporations claim will be completed by January end However none has either the electricity connection or the fire clearance and the corporations are yet to issue the completion certificate Parade Ground parking On Tuesday TOI found that the entrance was yet to be constructed Recently the North corporation had allowed surface level parking at Parade Ground but people had to struggle to get their vehicles in Also there were no attendants to help people resulting in haphazard parking A car is parked behind my car and we have been waiting for nearly two hours to take it out We had no option but to wait for its owner said Sukhbir Singh Chauhan who had come to collect his daughter s wedding cards from Chawri Bazaar The construction at the third floor of the basement is yet to be over The pending 2 work mostly electrical will be finished soon But the civic agency is yet to get the electricity connection and the fire clearance said A K Singh project manager Hauz Khas parking At Hauz Khas construction material has been dumped outside the main entrance Arti Mehra a senior BJP leader and former councillor of the area who had pushed for the project said I m told that the contractor is not finishing the work as the South corporation has to clear the payment of Rs 3 4 5 crore Post trifurcation the corporation doesn t have money to pay the contractor The money will be sanctioned in the next budget When we inaugurated it last year we were sure that the parking would be operational by March as not much work was pending The work could have got over in 10 15 days I don t know why there is a delay But South corporation commissioner Manish Gupta denied Mehra s claim of shortage of funds There is no shortage of funds and the payment has been made to the contractor Minor work is pending which will be completed by next month said Gupta Residents of Hauz Khas say that despite repeated complaints there has been no movement Local MLA and education minister Kiran Walia said she had got several complaints on this project How can the civic agency inaugurate a project which is not complete A few months ago cracks had developed in the parking I had visited the site along with the commissioner and asked him to carry out an inquiry A facility has been created for people but people can t use it said Walia NDMC parking project New Delhi Municipal Council NDMC is also not faring any better It inaugurated the automated multilevel parking at Baba Kharak Singh Marg in June 2012 but has failed to make it popular With redevelopment work going on in Connaught Place this parking constructed by DLF should have been the answer to the growing parking problem in the area But on an average less than 250 cars use this facility every day while it can accommodate 1 408 cars On Tuesday when TOI visited it at 3 30 pm the board for parking availability showed 1 060 cars and 289 SUVs while several cars were parked in double lines outside the Hanuman temple adjacent to the parking Parking is a serious problem on Tuesdays as it is considered to be Hanumanji s day We provide free parking said Sonu who helps people park their vehicles outside the temple On Tuesdays almost half of the road outside the temple had cars parked on it resulting in traffic snarls Though NDMC was supposed to close surface level parking in and around the temple nothing has been done The private concessionaire which has spent close to Rs 100 crore on the project says NDMC has to help it promote the parking We can t spend more money on promoting it The surface level parking should be closed so that people use the multilevel facility said Benu Sehgal vice president mall management DLF While NDMC has closed surface level parkings in the area there is no enforcement People continue to park on the main road NDMC spokesperson Amit Prasad said We have directed enforcement wing to take action One of the main reason why not many people use this parking is its poor connectivity with Connaught Place Though the civic agency has introduced e rickshaws the numbers are not sufficient But once people start using the parking we will increase the number said an NDMC official While the civic agencies seem least interested in completing or promoting these infrastructure projects it is the taxpayer who is at the receiving end And there is no accountability",

Kumar has grown up seeing his father a security guard do as much housework as his mother With a gender role model like that it is hardly surprising then that the 23 year old filmmaker does not leave sweeping swabbing cooking and washing clothes to his schoolgoing sister or mother There is nothing unusual in this all of us handle housework says Arvind who works as a filmmaker and facilitator with an NGO Community Aid and Sponsorship Program CASP This progressive thinking is at odds with the attitudes in the rest of the Sangam Vihar community to which Arvind belongs Arvind was among the hundreds of youngsters who were part of the Bal Panchayat programme in Sangam Vihar started by CASP back in 1993 along with the Plan India The project encourages young girls and boys of the locality to interact freely and bring an attitudinal change in how they perceive each other It has now moved from Sangam Vihar to Badarpur and former trainees like Arvind and Suraj have now turned facilitators for the programme training over 800 children in Badarpur and Madanpur Khadar We discuss issues such as gender safety and sexuality and this has made us very different from the other youth our age in this locality It s changed our attitude towards girls and women It s even changed the way we think of ourselves says Suraj Aggarwal 22 another participant in the project who lives in Badarpur The extent to which the interactions have changed mindsets is clear from Arvind s take on his sister s future She wasn t keen on studying further but he insisted that she take on a professional course to become financially independent She loves cooking So I have suggested that she pursue a diploma course in cooking or hotel management so that she can get a job doing what she loves says Arvind Though their thinking is quite enlightened Arvind and Suraj say they can understand why young men often prevent their sisters from veturing out to study or work A few people still talk rubbish if they see a girl coming home after tuitions with a male classmate It is also common knowledge that many boys talk insultingly about girls and sometimes misbehave with them It is difficult to hear taunts about your sister says Suraj But they are categorical that the boys they work with will have a more balanced view about gender roles and are unlikely to ever harass girls Boys don t know how to behave with girls because they are segregated most times So they either ignore them altogether or harass them Studying playing together and talking to each other help them develop a healthy camaraderie says Suraj Few gender programmes involve men or engage them in the gender equality discussion which is why Plan India chose to make men a large part of its Because I am a Girl campaign The stereotype is that caring for children is women s work Appealing to their concern for their children is one way of getting them more involved in the home and housework If a child grows up seeing the father taking care and being more engaged at home that child grows up emulating the behavior explains Bhagyashri Dengle executive director of Plan India She has seen entire localities change through the children in Bal Panchayats as they grow up and mentor the younger ones and influence their families Living within the communities Arvind and Suraj know that attitudinal change cannot happen overnight But they also believe that change is inevitable We don t see marriage as a route to finding someone to do our housework We can manage that very well ourselves It will be about finding someone to share our lives After all two incomes will also mean better lives for our children says Arvind Post a comment AR_1 ob text content height 50px important ALSO ON TOIBe careful while making statem Shocking Doctors busy

only reaction was Complete rubbish This must be a figment of someone s over active imagination Among the things that are said to be going in his favour Technocrat with no political base of his own Clean image Known to business Good interpersonal skills Was one of the founding members of Infosys who is not only wealthy in his own right but has also given away a lot of it Now has four and a half years experience in government as head of the Unique Identification project has had to work across states parties and ministries to implement one of the world s most ambitious and politically difficult public projects Will be a good face to project globally Is said to have a good equation with Sonia and especially Rahul At 58 is relatively young As an alumnus of IIT a symbol of modern day meritocracy His wife Rohini has impeccable credentials in the non profit sector having been a prime driver of a number of NGOs and a contributor to a few others Can possibly draw an army of young volunteers like the Aam Aadmi Party has That he is not averse to the rough and tumble of politics is obvious from his as yet unannounced decision to contest the Lok Sabha elections from South Bangalore for which he already has a large campaign team on the ground and running Obviously the opposition from within Congress will be intense There are leaders with many many more years of experience in politics and government and very strong credentials in running ministries Chidambaram in particular has held some of the most critical portfolios at the Centre from home to finance He has a great reputation for efficiency and energy as a reformer and for his grasp of complex issues Among the others Antony is known to have the absolute trust of the Gandhis while Shinde a Dalit speaks good Hindi has the experience of running a coalition government in Maharashtra and has an impeccable track record as a loyalist Nilekani by comparison is still a novice Also Manmohan Singh s performance is seen to have robbed technocrats of some of their sheen at least in the political arena If Nilekani s candidature gains currency Aadhaar is likely to come under even greater attack even as officials in the Unique Identification Authority of India point to the fact that 510 million cards have already been issued and the target of 600 million will be met in the next few months They see it as testimony to the execution skills of Nilekani and his ability to navigate the system often in the face of open as well as veiled opposition from within Discounting the speculation around Nilekani a senior Congress leader said First and foremost this assumes that a name will be announced and that Rahul isn t interested Just two days ago he vowed to work at transforming the Congress organisation Does that sound like he wants to step aside But there is a section within the Congress that believes Congress should make its choice known Said another senior party leader BJP and AAP have benefited from the fact that voters have a face \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd Modi and Kejriwal Of course Kejriwal is the founder of his party so there s no question of not projecting him But yes

two to three days to catch a monkey They don t find the remuneration sufficient to sustain a living in the city he said Seeing the lukewarm reaction the three civic bodies had on Monday increased the amount paid for every monkey caught from Rs 600 to Rs 800 We are planning to increase the amount further so that we can have sufficient number of monkey catchers said a North corporation official At present all three corporations have seven catchers between them We want to have a dedicated team of monkey catchers for each zone The monkeys caught are handed over to the wildlife department and released in the Jasola Bhatti mines said a South corporation official Surprisingly East corporation didn t have a monkey catcher until a month ago But our man has trapped 16 monkeys since he joined said Yadav The wildlife department is expected to conduct a monkey census in the city soon", "dateTime": "Feb 7, 2013, 01.37AM IST"}'],

return the excess amount to parents at 9 interest The Justice Anil Dev Singh committee which made the recommendation has also called for a special inspection by the Directorate of Education against 11 of these schools as their financial records didn t inspire any confidence DoE told to inspect 27 city schools var adSkipCounter 0 Submitting its second interim report in court the committee said in 47 of the 58 schools the fee hiked since 2009 was wholly or partially unjustified That is because either these schools had sufficient funds to meet the burden of increased staff salaries following the 6th pay commission recommendations or the fee hike was higher than what was required to pay increased salaries The committee has recommended refund of fee unjustly hiked by 58 schools Among these are 11 schools where the committee besides recommending the refund has also recommended special inspection to be carried out by the Directorate of Education the three member panel headed by former Rajasthan High Court Chief Justice Anil Dev Singh said The panel found 27 other schools had not submitted relevant records and wants DoE to inspect them again The committee said it had examined fee hikes by 148 schools In the case of 63 schools the committee has not recommended any intervention as the schools were found to have either not hiked the fee in pursuance of the order dated February 11 2009 issued by the DoE or the fee hiked was found to be within tolerance limit of 10 or the fee hike was found to be justified The report submitted before a bench of Justices B D Ahmed and Siddharth Mridul said a number of schools were found to have charged development fee out of line with the laid criteria It pointed out that while schools were quick to levy development fee as permitted by Supreme Court in 2004 they had turned a blind eye to conditions laid down by the court such as putting this money in separate development fund accounts The panel was shocked to find that in some schools the pay hike to teacher was taken back in the name of development of the school In its first report submitted on August 23 last year the panel had examined the fee hikes in 200 schools and then too recommended that 64 schools be asked to refund the excess fees with 9 interest The reports followed an earlier order of the court which is hearing a PIL of NGO Social Jurist that has accused private schools of unjustly raising fees The schools which will have to refund fee as per the panel s latest recommendations are Lovely Buds Public School Johripur Diamond Public School Yamuna Vihar

and diligence with which he is expected to discharge his official functions Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said Assistant Engineer Digvijay Singh has moved the sessions court challenging the order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate on November 10 2010 The MM had rejected his plea of seeking protection under Section 197 CrPC Filing a revision petition Singh contended that he being a public servant could not have been prosecuted without obtaining prior sanction from the competent authority as provided under Section 197 CrPC ASJ Bhat however rejected his plea saying the negligent conduct and attitude of a public servant can in no case be termed to be part and parcel of his official job The petitioner has been accused of dereliction of his official duties and therefore he cannot claim protection U s 197 Cr PC I find no infirmity in the order of the trial court Revision petition is without any merit Same is dismissed the court added As per the case Municipal Corporation of Delhi MCD officials on inspection of the complex just before the Commonwealth Games found mosquitoes breeding in the complex Accordingly the petitioner was booked for the offences punishable under the MCD malaria and mosquito borne diseases bylaws The charge against Singh was that being in charge of the court complex s maintenance he had failed to curb the breeding of mosquitoes there It was alleged that aedes mosquitoes were found breeding in the containers lying in the field which would have caused malaria dengue and similar diseases", "dateTime": "Mar 22, 2011, 02.09am IST"}'],

NCR 2021 has a clause that restricts constructions for regional recreational activities in natural conservation zones Documents obtained by SS Oberoi of Mission Gurgaon Development under RTI show that the proposal to do away with this restriction was moved by Haryana government in the 61st planning committee meeting held at the NCR Planning Board on June 4 2013 According to the minutes of the meeting Financial commissioner and principal secretary town and country planning department government of Haryana suggested that natural conservation zone para 17 5 3 iv relating to regional recreational activities restricted constructions of 0 5 may be deleted The design behind this move is clearly to allow a mega tourism complex at the Mangar forest off Gurgaon Faridabad road which is considered sacred by the locals Questions were raised by the environment ministry and NCRPB on why the draft Mangar development plan did not identify the forest as a conservation zone Now Haryana government has found another way of building the tourism complex They will get all their other pending projects cleared after the amended NCR plan comes into force Oberoi alleged Environment analyst Chetan Agrawal said that the change will have serious repercussion on the ecology of the entire NCR This blanket shift in planning norms will come as an advantage to all the state government to allow unlimited construction in eco sensitive zones The provision of identifying and protecting the eco sensitive areas has been there since 2005 when the 2021 plan was prepared But this has been ignored in the successive master plans by member states he said Agrawal added that the change goes against the thrust of NCRPB which has called for better planned development for sustainability and conservation of eco sensitive areas Constructions in natural conservation zones will threaten the catchment areas of major Aravali lakes such as Damdama and Dhauj The amended regional plan has been approved by the NCRPB apex committee which includes the Union urban development minister and chief ministers of Delhi Haryana Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan The board invited public objections to the draft revised plan which ended on Friday Ironically the draft plan notes with concern that green areas in NCR have declined from 4 3 in 1999 to 3 3 in 2012 a drop of 23 The document says more areas should be brought under green belts The first comparative satellite based study of change in land use in NCR had shown that between 1999 and 2012 the region lost 32 769 hectares of green areas and 1 464 hectares of water bodies While Uttar Pradesh recorded the maximum loss at 17 386 hectares Haryana lost 8 716 hectares NCRPB s nod for planning by states has become crucial after the Noida Extension episode where

an effort to add more revenue to its kitty Delhi Metro is installing giant LCD screens in five of its stations to help you indulge in some impulsive shopping The 46 inch screens coming up at Central Secretariat Chandni Chowk Patel Chowk Chawri Bazar and New Delhi stations will not only flash advertisements but also carry service and security messages said Delhi Metro officials While we have advertisements inside stations an animated screen is always a better way to catch the attention of commuters said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation DMRC official The screens will run commercials and brand promotions besides messages from Delhi Metro and will try to capture the viewers attention from 10 strategic positions within the station The screens will be placed at underground stations as the impact is maximum there Delhi Metro is planning to put in more such screens inside stations if it gets a good response The arrangement between the company RC and DMRC is in the 75 25 ratio with the former getting the lion s share of the advertising time and revenue Since we are also charging the vendor license fee both DMRC and the vendor will get a part of the revenue said the official The revenue collection is expected to be substantial said Priya Monga of RC A study of the footfalls and the profiles of passengers has given us a broad marketing range From advertisements about two wheelers to brand promotions a large range of consumers can be tapped here However DMRC has kept a few limitations The official cited the example of condom advertisements that had to be taken off after complains from commuters Delhi Metro also plans to use the giant screens for beaming security related messages More than announcements animated audio video clips or short films catch people s interest They would focus on security messages said the official DMRC says it has already started work on the messages for which an agency may be hired The giant screens will become functional from

will be encouraged to bid for government procurement but should provide medicines in generic names the document says Health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad recently said the ministry had received several

MCI received 824 such complaints following which it cancelled the registration of 10 doctors and warned four others Drug companies were recently caught red handed writing scientific recommendations of their own products and submitting them to the Drug Controller General of India DCGI after getting them endorsed by top doctors for quicker marketing approval Usually scientific recommendations are submitted by experts after they have studied a drug s content The endorsement is considered a crucial testimony that convinces the DCGI to trust the drug s effectiveness in turn allowing it to be

may have got longer According to the managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation DMRC E Sreedharan the modalities of handling security are still being worked out by the Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd DAMEPL and CISF The commissioner for metro rail safety had observed that security arrangements on the Airport Express line would need to be cleared by the ministry of home affairs Three days ago the government asked DAMEPL to get CISF on board for security var adSkipCounter 0 Talks are now on between the concessionaire and CISF Once that comes through the line should be opened said Sreedharan He however conceded that the opening would not take place any time this week The Airport Express line has been dogged by delays Last year the deadline was shifted several times from July to August to October in time for the Commonwealth Games The deferral hasn t found favour with the DMRC chief Speaking to TOI Sreedharan admitted that the delays have been disappointing The delays were unnecessarya\xef \xbd_ at DMRC we are not used to such delays he said And while DMRC has already imposed penalty on the concessionaire the DMRC chief was candid in his appraisal of the job done by DAMEPL We could ve easily and comfortably done the job by October Here we ve even had to give certification and training to the concessionaire in various areas The need to hand hold the concessionaire Sreedharan said that DMRC had to arrange for not only the CMRS inspections but also for the RDSO for certification to increase speed to 120kmph from the 105kmph allowed at present has been disappointing the Metro man admitted Sreedharan s skepticism is not difficult to share Despite already paying a penalty to the DMRC it has paid Rs 22 crore with Rs 32 crore yet to be paid and another Rs 8 10 crore left as accrual DAMEPL has been consistently missing deadlines Even now it plans to open the Airport Express Metro line without two of its major stations Dhaula Kuan and Aerocity NH8 as these are still under construction So is the public private partnership model on which the Airport Express project was undertaken flawed Sreedharan seemed ambivalent In the Metro scenario PPP model may not work as it means that the private company needs to make returns from the project which is not always successful But here since it s an airport line the scenario is different as one can levy high charges we ve set a cap of Rs 150 for instance So the concessionaire can easily recover its costs within a year he said Incidentally DAMEPL will be running the Metro line on BOT basis for a period of 30 years paying DMRC a fee of Rs 45 crore and 5 of annual collections The good news Sreedharan seemed upbeat about the train speed on the line going up from 105kmph to 120kmph The difference in speed will not really be felt by the passengers as it ll take 19 minutes from New Delhi station to IGI Airport at 105kmph speed while it would take 18 minutes at 120kmph But we wanted the certification for the high speed train So the request has been sent for RDSO inspection which is awaited he added He was confident that with Air India on board the rest of the airlines would also be willing to avail of the check in facility at the Metro station Once the Metro starts within 48 hours we expect the rest of the check in counters to be available as well apart from Air India said

health", "contents": "Women in India face discrimination even when it comes to their heart health Three separate studies one of them from India and the other two from China and West Asia presented at the World Congress of Cardiology in Dubai on Friday said that women don t receive the same treatment as men for heart disease across the world var adSkipCounter 0 They said that women with acute coronary syndrome ACS receive inferior or less aggressive treatment compared to men The CREATE registry study of 20 468 patients in India revealed that relatively fewer women are admitted with ACS Moreover these women are older reach hospital later more prone to risk receive inferior treatments and have worse outcomes These three studies paint a consistent picture around the world and all serve to demonstrate that women with ACS are unfortunately not receiving the same treatment as men said Professor Sidney C Smith president of World Heart Federation This is something that has to be addressed as a matter of urgency Smith said Dr Ramakant Panda chief of Asian Heart Institute who is attending the Dubai conference agreed to the studies findings India is worst when it comes to taking care of its women Women s health is of low priority in the household Instead it is the woman who looks after family and ensures that good health of others There is also a common misconception that women don t get heart diseases Dr Panda said He added Most of the women who come to us with heart diseases come late and often when complications have taken place This is why outcomes are poor and the complications related to CVDs are higher Heart attack mortality among women is also higher due to smaller heart vessels Awareness needs to increase on women s health CVD which includes heart disease and stroke is the biggest killer of women globally causing 8 6 million deaths annually Women in low and middle income countries who develop CVD are more likely to die from it than comparable women in industrialized nations However women do not perceive CVD as the greatest threat to their health they still feel more threatened by cancer than they do by CVD The good news is that there are steps women can take to protect their hearts These include stopping smoking engaging in physical exercise maintaining a healthy weight and ensuring a healthy food intake said Smith The BRIG project study of 3 168 patients in China concluded that a substantial portion of women with ACS did not receive proper treatment during hospitalization compared with men Similarly a study of 4 229 ACS patients in the West Asia found that women tended to be admitted to hospital later than men and had more comorbid disease These women received commonly used treatments less frequently than men although in the case of the West Asia study this did not appear to impact in patient mortality A study conducted by doctors at the AIIMS had earlier found that among children who require heart surgery boys have a much better chance of undergoing the procedure than girls Published in the medical journal Heart the study interviewed parents of 405 children aged up to 12 years who had been advised to undergo elective pediatric cardiac surgery at AIIMS When their status was reviewed after a year doctors found 44 59 134 of the girls had undergone surgery against 70 189 271 of boys The study estimates that for every 70 boys who undergo an operation for congenital heart defect only 22 girls undergo the surgery The families of 31 out of 134 girls 23 1 felt the need to conceal the illness of their child from relatives and friends compared with just 4 out of 271 1 5 boys families A post operative scar on the chest of the child was perceived as a problem for the parents of 62 of girls 83 134 as compared with only 6 of boys 16 271 Around 65 of parents of girls feared that surgery might dampen the matrimonial prospects of their child while just 2 of the boys parents felt so Female gender is an important determinant of non compliance with pediatric cardiac surgery Deep seated social factors underlie this gender bias said the study conducted by Dr Sivasubramanian Ramakrishnan and Dr Anita Saxena from AIIMS department of cardiology The economic class of the parents was also an important factor that determined whether the child would undergo the surgery More than 80 of children in the upper and upper middle classes had undergone surgery as compared with less than 60 of patients in the lower middle and upper lower classes The percentage of patients undergoing surgery progressively decreased from the upper class 90 to the upper lower class 21 3 In India around 1 8 lakh children are born with congenital heart disease CHD each year of whom 60 000 90 000 require early intervention The team of researchers has now proposed a nationwide special programme to address this issue A fixed amount should be given to a girl less than 12 years of age who undergoes cardiac surgery It should be in the form of a fixed deposit encashable when the patient turns 20 If a repeat surgery is needed the money should be reimbursed from the national illness fund for girls said the authors",

hotels are now among the 12 hospitality majors that face an indefinite delay in opening The master plan approved for IGIA s modernization in 2007 had earmarked the area next to the tunnel road strategically located between terminal 1D and T3 for the hospitality district called Aerocity The plan was cleared in a rush so that T3 and some hotels in Aerocity could be ready in time for the October 2010 Commonwealth Games var adSkipCounter 0 The hotels have missed the Games deadline by a long mark and there is still no certainty about when guests can start checking in Thanks to security fears being raised by Delhi Police since 2011 and new demands for upgrading safety procedures the hotels \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd whose 5 400 rooms represent an investment of Rs 12 000 crore \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd don t know what they could be asked to do next to be allowed to open Recently the aviation ministry asked the hotels to use bulletproof glass in windows of rooms facing the runway This directive sent the hotels into a tizzy especially since most of them have already completed fitting windows with ordinary glass Security experts say bulletproofing comes in handy when trying to protect someone inside the room rather than outside If someone was to shoot from inside the room he or she will be able to shatter the bulletproof glass in a couple of shots A team of officials from various security and aviation agencies will tour Amsterdam and Dallas airport hotels in the first week of April to examine the safety infrastructure in place there After that summer trip to cooler climes more directives are likely to emerge Apart from security fears and the equally fearsome ways of allaying them GMR led Delhi International Airport Pvt Ltd DIAL which is the agency responsible for developing IGIA is yet to provide basic infrastructure like roads in Aerocity Three mid segment properties \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd Ibis Lemon Tree and Red Fox \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd have been ready for months and the ultra luxury J W Marriott will be completed in April Lemon Tree Red Fox are losing about Rs 20 25 lakh a day due to the delay These four hotels alone account for 1 325 rooms that can end the perennial shortage of hotel accommodation close to the airport They will also help make hotel accommodation more affordable in Delhi which is notorious for its high tariff and almost complete absence of decent mid segment hotels Understandably developers are not happy with the state of affairs The land was given to developers four years back and work started a year later Security requirements have to be met and there is no dispute on that But it is unfortunate that the requirements are being conveyed when the hotels are ready instead of developers being told about them when the hotels were being constructed There are thousands of crores worth of investment at stake here said Uttam Dave president Interglobe Hotels that is developing Ibis along with Accor group at Aerocity Ankur Bhatia of the Bird group that is developing Dusit D2 said All the developers have made a significant amount of investment and ideally no project should face a delay in opening Globally hotels exist in aerotropolises a name given for airport cities like London Heathrow New York JFK Paris CDG and Amsterdam Schipol \xef \xbd\xef \xbd\xef \xbd which are located in close proximity to the respective airports Security agencies in Delhi are objecting to the very concept of an aerotropolis or Aerocity in this case The seven storey hotels are coming up about 300 m away from the main runway and the Palam Technical Area used by presidents and prime ministers for flying in and out of Delhi This security officials say can be a potential threat The police are also objecting to the fact that four hotels have windows facing these critical areas and some extreme suggestions have ranged from having the windows replaced by brick walls to razing down an entire floor Luckily such ideas have so far emerged only in brainstorming sessions and have not been issued as directives The hotels led by Marriott that has upgraded security at all its properties globally following the devastating attack on its Islamabad hotel in 2008 claim to have taken all possible steps for foolproof safety But the constant and unending stream of security do s given to the hotels has made them jittery It is ironic that twin storey slums exist right next to Mumbai airport with some second floors even having a runway facing balcony Those are not considered threats but international chains of hotels taking all possible safety measures are said a senior aviation ministry official", "dateTime": "Mar 13, 2013, 04.23AM IST"}'],

problems faced by pilgrims in the wake of reported misbehaviour with them in Saudi Arabia he said according to a press release A national programme was proposed in this regard but it could not be held for some reasons It would now be held next year and efforts would be made to invite the ambassador of Saudi Arabia to India he said var adSkipCounter 0 Instead of government employees imams of mosques and madrasa teachers should be sent as Khadim ul Hujjaj servants of haj pilgrims but the Central Haj Committee and departments of the Government of India were not paying any heed to this suggestion he said Employees with high connections get themselves selected as hujjaj and on reaching Saudi Arabia they do not take care of the pilgrims he said It would be better if poor Muslims were selected as they would not only serve the pilgrims but also get a chance to undertake haj the minister added He said in today s lottery applicants from 11 districts had been selected He said this year 32 214 applications had been received out of which 1 998 applicants belong to reserved category On this occasion Azam Khan who is also chairman of the State Haj Committee did not forget to settle score with Congress and the BSP He targeted the previous chairman Naseemuddin Siddiqui of BSP saying The previous chairman held the portfolio of excise which is concerned with liquor policy and people with Muslim names should not accept such jobs Azam without naming Mayawati also stated that when women on high post start using rough language democratic norms are flouted It was with reference to Mayawati s recent announcement that she will break the bones of Samajwadi Party workers on coming to power She is giving examples of poor law and order in the state During her regime people from only one section of the society were appointed in police stations he stated On Union steel minister Beni Prasad Verma s outburst against Mulayam Azam claimed Beni is his old friend and needs dua blessings these days Azam also attacked Imam Ahmad Bukhari of Jama Masjid Delhi stating that when people of high stature start bargaining in the name of the whole millat community it is shameful Bukhari who had supported Mulayam before the elections is now on a warpath and has put up a front against Akhilesh Yadav said Azam", "dateTime": "Apr 23, 2013, 04.12AM IST"}'],

main road in front of Samachar Apartments and it has become difficult for us to walk on this road I thought MCD would do something about it he said in exasperation When told that this page was only for complaints related to designated garbage collection sites in the city a disappointed Goyal said What s the point of addressing problems related to dhalaos only The streets are extremely dirty Who will clean them Like Goyal there are hundreds of Delhiites who have complained about everything except overflowing dhalaos People have posted pictures of the pathetic condition of roads waterlogging rampant illegal constructions encroachments on public space in various parts of the city etc This is the scene at Block H Sector 3 of Bawana industrial area We have already lodged a complaint but there is no response from your side Please take a action as soon as possible wrote Ankit Jain putting up a photo of a waterlogged road Another illegal construction in progress Hope Laxmi Nagar is not

responsible for doing it From citizens point of view garbage is garbage be it in the bins or in the collection sites she wrote MCD conceded that it had got an overwhelming response from people Despite so many visitors only 30 odd genuine complaints regarding dhalaos were received of which MCD officials claim they have taken action in 20 cases We have got a great response from people They have really appreciated our efforts To begin with we wanted to focus just on the dhalaos as we have nearly 2078 dhalaos in the city It is a big task to monitor these dhalaos Unfortunately many comments received on the page do not pertain to MCD or the dhalaos We are asking people who have complaints regarding other issues to get in touch with the control room said Anshu Prakash additional

With the minimum temperature in Delhi as high as 14 degrees Celsius on Tuesday five degrees above normal conditions were not at all favourable for formation of a long spell of dense fog Instead

Analysis of the latest meteorological features related to wind moisture minimum temperature and stability conditions show that conditions are still not suitable for long duration of intense fog conditions However due to a very higher moisture incursion in the atmosphere during the past 24 hours and heavy fog already persisting just about 50 100km east of Delhi over Utter Pradesh there is high chance of advection fog formation over Delhi airport between 7am and 9am reducing runway visual range to CAT III levels during the next 48 hours said Jenamani He added that the fog over Delhi and neighbouring areas on Tuesday morning had actually formed over UP and Bihar and had been blown over the capital by easterly winds However there is enough moisture in the atmosphere now for fog to form over Delhi as well and the second wind direction changes to northerly the cold winds from the snowed in Himalayas will bring down temperatures and duration of fog may increase he said However once wind direction changes strong winds are also being expected that will not let fog linger On Tuesday the maximum temperature in Delhi was 27 4 degrees three degrees above normal The coolest place in

"contents": "It was a quiet moment of joy for the common man who still frequents the Indian Coffee House at Connaught Place The coffee house has been included in the Time magazine s list of 25 Authentic Asian Experiences One of the few landmarks in Delhi to have held its own since the 1940s the coffee house was abuzz with life on Tuesday as old timers and newbies chatted over coffee Delighted to hear of this honour the visitors and the staff said this recognition may help the coffee house reclaim its lost glory Located on the third floor of the Mohan Singh Place building the coffee joint is still a huge draw Even in this scorching heat the open air section of the joint was packed with customers It s addictive None of us are here for the food or just the coffee It s just a place to kill time and only the place for the common man People can afford to come here and not feel they have a burnt a hole in the pocket I am not surprised that it has been honoured by a foreign magazine laughed Gurnam Singh who has been coming here almost everyday since 1953 Back then the price of a cup of coffee was a princely ek anna he said When it was raised to char anna many years later Singh said he had started worrying that the coffee house may become expensive His fears were misplaced as even today a cup of coffee here costs just Rs 15 In the 50s the Indian Coffee House was located where the Palika Bazar stands today That closed down suddenly Former law minister Shanti Bhushan and many prominent politicians used to come here regularly Indira Gandhi too came here once but just for a few minutes Journalists used to sit here and deliberate over important issues and policies Artists and writers also used to frequent this place said Gurnam who despite his failing eyesight comes here daily all the way from Anand Vihar It is the aroma of coffee he says that draws him to this place Youngsters are equally enthralled by the laidback old world charm of the place Friends told us about this place I have been to the Shimla Chandigarh and Kolkata coffee house They all have the same ambience This is just the right place to meet friends It s very inclusive and affordable for all said Karuna Ahuja a student Though she added she misses the antiquated look of the Kolkata Coffee House Comparisons apart the coffee house is definitely no longer a place just for the retired to pass time Most young customers felt that if the Indian Coffee House is maintained it can make a great tourist haunt The staff uniform with the turbans and red and green belts reminded some of the colonial times This place has character I quite like the decor and sartorial style of the staff Moreover nobody here pushes the customers to leave as soon as they are done with food said Sagar Raha another student In 2009 there were reports that the joint would be closed due to the outstanding rent to be paid to New Delhi Municipal Corporation NDMC However the Indian Coffee House consumers forum managed to fight pressure from authorities It is here to stay and in the words of one of the old timers the joint would continue stirring pyar mohabbat wali coffee for the common man in Delhi Post a

Delay may be one of the factors contributing rise in the number of such cases in as much as on account of such delay deterrence pales into insignificance Time has come when these cases have to be

especially women speedy justice Justice Kabir in his January 5 letter said the incident shook the nation s conscience and asked the CJs ensure that cases relating to offences against women are fast tracked and taken up for hearing on priority basis both at the High Court and district levels Significantly the CJI has also taken a New Year initiative to revive the important annual conference of Chief Justices which was discontinued for more than two years during his predecessor Justice S H Kapadia s tenure The CJI in his January 2 letter to the CJs had said the April 5 7 conference would focus on fast tracking of matters relating to offences against women Not satisfied with the letter fixing agenda for April meeting the CJI wrote to the CJs against just three days later asking them to begin the process of fast tracking the trial in crime against women cases forthwith without waiting for the Conference s outcome On January 2 the CJI had inaugurated the first of the five fast track courts at Saket in New Delhi to deal with cases relating to offences against women The Delhi government has already taken steps to appoint 150 new judicial officers with 1 085 support staff Three days later he was writing to the CJs requesting them to take steps to immediately set up fat track courts to deal exclusively with cases of offences against women by deputing officers from existing pool of judicial officers However Justice Kabir said the CJs must undertake the exercise to identify the number of sessions Judges and Magistrates along with number of support staff for the additional fast track courts needed to be set up to speed up trial in cases relating to crime against women and approach the state governments for requisite increase in strength of judicial officers and support staff I am sure that judging the present day scenario the state government Union Territory will not decline the genuine demand of the Judiciary he said At present 3 670 posts of trial Judges and over 250

Yamuna was a revered river and people from far and near gathered to take a dip in its waters in Delhi on every celestial event and festival The French traveller Francois Bernier who witnessed a solar eclipse here in 1666 notes I took my station on the terrace of my house situated on the banks of the Gemna when I saw both shores of the river for nearly a league 5 6 km in length covered with gentiles or idolaters who stood in the water up to the waist Such scenes were witnessed on the banks of all major rivers across north India on Monday barring the Yamuna in Delhi The polluted river was bereft of devotees taking a holy dip to mark the beginning of the harvest season Even the administration made no arrangements for devotees not expecting any to turn up to bathe in the dirty waters var adSkipCounter 0 The 22km stretch of the river through Delhi is practically a sewer Excluding the monsoon months the river is completely deprived of a fresh water flow and creeps towards Uttar Pradesh carrying only Delhi s waste Doctors warn that the river s water has chemicals and microbes that can cause serious skin troubles Dermatologist Dr Kabir Sardana says pollutants in the Yamuna pose a serious threat to immune compromised patients They can get skin infections Bathing in the river can also cause flaring of eczema irritation dryness and increased fragility of hair among other issues One should avoid bathing in the river water Even if one does so for religious reasons precautions like washing the body with normal water immediately thereafter and not drinking the water must be taken So far Rs 4 439 crore has been spent on cleaning the river but other than its worsening water quality nothing has changed The New Delhi Municipal Committee and the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi have spent an additional Rs 315 crore for river cleaning work that includes creation of toilets and cleaning of drains UP and Delhi have also recently been pulled up by the Supreme Court on their ineffective work Central Pollution Control Board has been monitoring the water quality of the river including the working of sewage treatment plants and effluent treatment plants in Delhi In court it revealed that the installed sewage treatment capacity in Delhi is 2 460 million litres per day against sewage generation of 3 800 mld Only about 63 of the installed capacity is being used as several areas lack a sewer network many drains are blocked and some STPs do not function to capacity With 1 360 mld of sewage flowing into the river untreated the effort to treat the remaining sewage has come to naught Delhi Jal Board has launched an ambitious project to solve the problem The interceptor sewage system entails laying of parallel drains along Delhi s three main drains Shahdara Supplementary and Najafgarh These drains will trap all sewage falling into the drains take it to STPs and carry treated sewage back to the drain Work on these will take another two to three years However even this will not be able to bring the pollution down to levels where the water can be categorized as bathing quality CPCB officials say dissolved oxygen DO a measure of the amount of oxygen available in dissolved form in water is necessary to support aquatic life If it drops below a certain level life forms specifically fish are unable to continue living Downstream of Khajoori Paltoon Pul the point where the Najafgarh drain meets the river DO is down to zero Microbial levels are also very high by the time the water reaches Okhla Bridge", "dateTime": "Jan 15,

police officials said they should not travel with strangers nor accept eatables from them Travellers should also keep their relatives informed of their whereabouts and communicate the number of the taxi they have boarded they said While Sen fell prey to criminals many others travelling between Delhi and Noida and the other NCR towns are harassed and have close brushes with criminals every day as only the expensive radio cabs move across interstate borders with valid permits Passengers not only pay extortionate rates but also travel on drivers terms such as accommodating strangers UP and Delhi autos do not go across the state border As a result a journey to Mayur Vihar Extension costs around Rs 150 but a ride to Noida s Sector 14 just 1 5km ahead costs Rs 300 A drop at Sector 63 Noida never

association the case will come up again on October 17 The traders allege they have built the sewage system with their limited means but the system is not connected with the sewage lines of the surrounding areas There is no proper outlet for the sewage system It reeks of filth and dirt and there is stagnant water everywhere So many diplomats visit the market but no one has bothered with improving the condition of the market They would rather have people walking around with a cloth or hands over their mouths to keep the foul smell at bay said the owner of Krishan Lal Masala Store Kamal Sharma The traders claim their market is under the Land Development Office and has not been transferred to any civic body as yet The market has 275 shops which sell imported grocery products poultry and seafood among other things We have been running after all civic agencies to resolve the maintenance problem but no one is willing to do anything The Municipal Corporation of Delhi MCD is more than willing to collect the property tax and the licence fees from us but distances itself from the market beyond this The New Delhi Municipal Council NDMC which is responsible for parking has at least improved that area besides upgrading the footpaths said Bhutani MCD had promised to improve the area by constructing fancy kiosks before the Commonwealth Games but nothing has been done so far We are in the process of setting up 151 kiosks These kiosks will be the temporary tehbazaari sites which will be allocated to the vendors in the area As far as maintenance of the market is concerned it is not under us It is a Central Public Works Department market said MCD spokesperson Deep Mathur We have been fighting for the ownership rights of our shops We paid money in the early 90s to enable the government to lease out these shops to us But this never happened said Surinder Dua the owner of Vishal Silk Store Dua said that with the presence of several chicken and meat shops and lack of proper waste disposal the market emanates a foul smell all the time", "dateTime": "Jul 17, 2011, 06.45am IST"}'],

forest land in the Aravalis", "contents": "A law that was meant to reverse fragmentation of agricultural land appears to have been rampantly abused in Haryana to allow influential private players get possession of hilly and non agricultural common lands including forests in the Aravalis close to the national capital The law in question is the Consolidation Act enacted to consolidate agricultural holdings of farmers who own land in small patches spread over an area and for preserving the village commons Officials said in Faridabad and Gurgaon districts of Haryana this law had been twisted to give outsiders vast tracts of common hilly land and forests including the pristine grove of Mangar Bani held sacred by villagers var adSkipCounter 0 According to records accessed by TOI the modus operandi was exposed a few months ago by Ashok Khemka who as the director general of land records had also cancelled an unrelated land deal involving Robert Vadra For the first time in Haryana Khemka challenged the practice of partitioning of common hilly land via the consolidation process and denotified it in two cases at villages Kot and Roz ka Gujjar in August 2012 The then director general of land records in his order on Faridabad s Kot village said the consolidation exercise carried out in the entire village including its gair mumkin pahaar common hill would wrongly benefit certain influential outsider purchasers The aims and objects of the Consolidation Act are to consolidate agricultural holdings for the betterment of agriculture for prevention of fragmentation of agricultural holdings and for reservation of land for common purposes of the village the order said The officer wrote that of the total area of 3 184 acres notified for consolidation in Kot 2 565 acres fell under common hill area and the inclusion of this portion would defeat the purpose of consolidation Even more blatant was the case of Roz ka Gujjar an uninhabitated and mostly forested hill completely located in the Aravalis which formed the main catchment of the Damdama lake in Gurgaon Of the 5 744 acres brought under consolidation in this village close to 4 798 acres were notified under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act PLPA Under the Forest Conservation Act land under these two notifications cannot be diverted for any use other than forest related activities without permission of the Union environment and forest ministry Khemka in his order had pointed out that quite a large portion of the land in Roz ka Gujjar had been mined for stone ordinary sand and silica sand prior to 2002 There were 50 60 feet deep mining pits in certain pockets In his order the IAS officer also observed that the village was be chirag uninhabited and there was a single khewat record consisting of more 1 000 co owners having joint share in the entire area of 5 744 acres He also pointed out that not a single square inch of the land under consolidation had been cultivated for a long time Expectedly hardly any locals figured in the names of the co sharers Almost the entire area had been purchased by the powerful business politico bureaucratic police nexus with ostensibly no interest in agricultural cultivation activities Moreover some land transactions seemed benami on behalf of a few powerful politicians and bureaucrats Khemka had pointed out The officer who was allegedly shunted out for hurting higher ups had recorded in his order that since there was no land under agricultural activity there was no fragment of land to consolidate On a perusal of the consolidation records it is apparent that the scope of the Consolidation Act has been extended as a tool of partition The single joint khewat has been divided into some 640 khataunis accounts and specific khasra numbers allotted to them Khemka s wrote The order said the use of the Consolidation Act to partition a joint single khewat was a grotesque abuse Even retired officials from revenue department posted in the NCR said lands falling under hills or drains were nobody s property and could not be fragmented This law has been violated in many cases including Mangar which has a sacred forest protected by local Gujjar villagers Sources said the process of consolidation and then division of this common land hill was completed long ago enabling several to buy huge chunks of land With the Mangar development plan 2031 likely to be notified soon these players are expecting big gains in the form of escalated property prices The Haryana government should review the status of the common lands in the more than 100 villages of southern Haryana and secure such land that should be preserved for future generations said Chetan Agarwal a forest analyst In the light of recent Supreme Court judgments that say common lands should not be privatized the sale of lands around Mangar and other villages should be retrospectively reviewed and if necessary reversed said Colonel Sarvadaman Oberoi a legal activist fighting to save the Aravalis With the Mangar development plan 2031 likely to be notified soon these players are expecting big gains in the form of escalated property prices",

Commissioner for Rail Safety CMRS starting the two day inspection of the 22km long Airport Express Line on Friday there s hope that the much awaited Metro link to the Indira Gandhi International Airport will finally be opened to the public next week The inspection seemed to have gone well we have carried out our own inspections before inviting the CMRS especially on those issues pointed out in the previous inspection We are hopeful that the line will clear the safety check this time said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation DMRC official Both DMRC and the consortium Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd DAMEPL which is the concessionaire for the line have been claiming for the past fortnight that the line is ready for use var adSkipCounter 0 The CMRS inspection comes almost three months after the line had failed to get the safety clearance in an earlier inspection due to some technical glitches While CMRS RK Kardam refused to divulge the findings of the inspection on the first day he admitted that previous glitches had been addressed I will only talk about it the findings of the inspection after Saturday said Kardam DMRC officials however are more optimistic Officials claimed that the doubts raised by the CMRS earlier had been addressed and that they were more confident of getting the clearance this time around Once the safety clearance is obtained it will take less than a week to open the line for public In all probability the line should start next week said a DMRC official The Airport Express Line is running behind schedule It was expected to become functional before the Commonwealth Games in October 2010 However the failure to get safety clearance threw the line almost three months behind schedule It was also the first time that a Metro line had failed to get safety clearance from the CMRS in Delhi Metro s eight year history The Airport Express Line will reduce travel time between the IGI Airport and the heart of Delhi to 20 minutes Trains on this line would run at a much higher speed According to DAMEPL a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure the trains will run at 120 kmph Metro trains in Delhi run at an average speed of around 40 kmph DMRC had bid out the line to DAMEPL on public private partnership basis DMRC had laid the track and built the civil structures besides supplying the rolling stock An issue that still remains to be resolved for the smooth running is the differences between the concessionaire and the various airlines over setting up of check in counters at select stations on the line The 22 km line will initially remain open for 16 hours daily between 6am and 10pm There will be four stations to begin with New Delhi Shivaji Stadium IGI Airport and Dwarka Sector 21 Two stations Dhaula Kuan and NH 8 will be added to the line later

pick up on Akshaya Tritiya after a fall in demand due to inflation and the recent strike over the proposals made in this year s budget Jewellers across the country had called a 21 day strike in March over imposition of excise duty on unbranded jewellery levying of tax collection at source and doubling of customs duty on gold We are anticipating resurgence in demand on Akshaya Tritiya The fact that gold prices have remained stable since March will further strengthen buyers confidence says Vimal Kumar Goyal president of Delhi Bullion and Jewellers Welfare Association The rates have been hovering between Rs 27 000 and Rs 28 000 per 10g for some time now This makes the market favourable for purchasing though the prices are higher compared to what they were during the same period last year he says Jewellers are counting on Akshaya Tritiya to also make up for the slack during Navaratra last month as a large part of the festive season was spent in protesting against the changes proposed in the budget Normally business is brisk during Navaratra but the strike led to a dent in profits After the strike there was hardly any sale to cushion the blow says Ankit Kohli who owns Karol Bagh s Raj Jewellers As it is the demand had been punctured by sky high prices adds Kohli A report by the World Gold Council bears out his claims Demand for gold in India for jewellery and investment purposes dipped by 7 year on year it says It also said demand for gold in the country might remain high due to the cultural link with the metal but lower number of auspicious days in the 2012 Hindu Calendar relative to recent years is likely to temper gold demand to some degree However jewellers say going by the present purchasing trend heavy purchases in jewellery particularly light weight jewellery seem likely", "dateTime": "Apr 23, 2012, 12.55AM IST"}'],

to flag off four new trains and also raise the frequency of few others eyebrows were raised even in the railway ministry The station which was established in 1936 as a halt point has undergone little modernization over the years var adSkipCounter 0 The waiting hall is crumbling and we don t even have a decent washroom Moreover the stabling yard is inadequate to handle so many trains It is surprising that the railway board told the minister to introduce trains to Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir and Bandra in Mumbai Most trains originating from here are scheduled for short distances mostly till Rajasthan We do not know how passengers of a full AC train to Udhampur will react to the facilities here said an officer A Northern Railway official said the initial plan was to handle all new east bound trains from the Anand Vihar terminal while those to the west and the north were to be regulated at the Bijwasan and the Holambi Kalan stations both of which were to be developed into world class terminals Over the past three years the budgetary allocations for Anand Vihar phase II constructions remained stagnant efforts are on to open the fourth platform along with the Bijwasan and Holam Kalan projects But now suddenly the Sarai Rohilla station has been propped up said an official I have been using this station for years now Forget long distance passengers even daily commuters have been demanding basic facilities at the station We want amenities like a food joint and clean toilets But each time we have been told that it s the big three New Delhi Old Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin that are taking away all the budgetary allocations said Yogendra Sharma member of the local railway passengers association There have been instances when there have been serious question marks on the security at the station at night said sources The station does not have a taxi stand and the entry and the exit points are an eyesore If we are to make this station a success there should be a serious discussion with the police on managing both the security and the traffic here said another officer The fate of the Anand Vihar terminal is yet to be known In the phase II the number of platforms will be increased to seven in total and the terminal will have a capacity to handle over three hundred thousand passengers and as many as 270 trains daily Phase II of the Anand Vihar makeover involves linking the terminal with the original Anand Vihar station Station code ANVT which is a roadside station comprising two platforms serviced by only sub urban trains For phase II of Anand Vihar Northern Railways has invited a consultant for upgrading the station with world class facilities but the efforts are yet to bear fruit Full Coverage on Budget 2012 Budget 2012\xef \xbd\xef

"contents": "Forty eight hours after serial blasts ripped through Mumbai the police are frantically scouring CCTV footage for clues The hidden cameras are proving to be priceless for a police force scrambling for leads But is Delhi which too is perpetually on the terror radar equipped to thwart a jihadi strike Yes there s some succour for a city on the edge When TOI did a reality check of various markets in the city we found CCTV cameras in place in most of these busy hangouts meticulously tracking every movement every suspicious object lying unattended But Connaught Place and the Jama Masjid area all terror flashpoints are yet to be mapped A senior police officer said CCTV cameras have been installed at Janpath market In CP inner circle and outer circle there are no cameras right now It can be due to the redevelopment work in progress there These will be installed in phase II of the project var adSkipCounter 0 But there s a reassuring feeling though when enters the GK I police station Sitting inside the master control room SHO Vijay Kumar Singh is monitoring every movement in the M Block market and its neighbouring areas Any suspicious object lying in any corner can be immediately tracked down All this has been possible after the installation of 25 hi tech CCTV cameras There are 11 revolving CCTV cameras and 10 fixed ones inside the M Block market They have been placed in close proximity to record every minute movement An officer is posted round the clock in the surveillance room said a senior police official at GK I police station He said the cameras were installed six months ago and they are fully functional These cameras can record objects at a distance of up to 100 metres and recorded videos can be reviewed till 45 days The surveillance system also acts as a deterrent against crime Moreover there have been instances in which carjackers were caught through this sytem the police officer said Around 827 cameras were installed in Phase I of the project Surveillance is done 24x 7 and even has night vision The cameras meet international specifications and are new We have placed rotating cameras in areas where angles of vision need to be changed Depending on how busy the market place is we have the requisite number of cameras and personnel manning them said a senior police officer TOI also conducted checks at Sarojini Nagar Lajpat Nagar and Janpath and found no major glitches in the CCTV system Twenty five CCTV cameras keep vigil out for any trouble at the SN Market which was ripped apart by blasts in 2005 Most cameras have been installed recently under the Phase I of project They are all functional said a senior police officer There are 15 foot high watch towers at the entrance Here a policeman holds fort round the clock After the Mumbai blasts hawkers have been removed from the sidewalks for better monitoring But there is no frisking of people The woman cop has gone out for lunch So women are not being frisked right now We are checking carrybags and vehicles entering the market said a policeman at the Lajpat Nagar central market The market has 29 CCTV surveillance cameras Shockingly though TOI found no CCTV cameras at Connaught Place or across the Jama Masjid area At Jama Masjid CCTV cameras have been installed inside the historic mosque but cameras are yet to be installed at the entrance gates A senior functionary of the mosque said CCTVs installed inside are not functional and they have complained to the authorities several times The railways stations officials claim are also secured by CCTV surveillance We have 200 cameras installed across the major station 52 at New Delhi railway station 55 at Old Delhi railway station and about 20 CCTV cameras at the Nizamuddin station among others Small stations like the ones at Safdarjung Delhi Cantonment do not have CCTVs said a northern railway spokesperson He said 5 10 cameras are not functional due to technical glitches and will be repaired soon Delhi Police began installing CCTV cameras in market places and border check posts just before the Commonwealth Games With the first phase almost over the second phase will commence soon In the first round cameras were put up at the check posts at Badarpur Dilshad Colony Maharjpur and Singh Border said the police Both fixed and PTZ point tilt zoom cameras are installed in these areas The PTZs can rotate 360 degrees We have local control rooms at each of these places manned by the local police as well as a central control room in the police headquarters to monitor the cameras said special commissioner of police operations Deepak Mishra The cameras on the border check posts record the number plates of vehicles so that criminals can be traced at later dates said cops The cameras

after gangster Bunty of the notorious biker gang was killed in an encounter a trial court on Thursday sentenced three of his gang members to 17 years in jail each in one of the many cases of robbery and attempt to murder registered against them Additional sessions judge Rajender Kumar Shastri held biker gang members Zakir Israel and Om Shiv guilty of firing at oil dealer Pawan Kumar and his nephew Naresh in Ambedkar Nagar with an intention to rob them on July 12 2008 While the convicts got seven years rigorous imprisonment for attempt to robbery the court sentenced them to 10 years in jail for attempt to murder Sentences imposed upon them will run consecutively said ASJ Shastri who also imposed a fine of Rs 30 000 each on the convicts var adSkipCounter 0 In July 2008 the notorious biker gang had spread terror across the capital with incidents of armed robbery dacoities and shootouts in broad daylight becoming common The terror finally ended with the leader of the gang Bunty and one of his aide getting killed in an encounter in August that year The other members were arrested by Delhi Police following a shootout between cops and the gang on during the early hours of August 25 2008 Comparing the convicts with an infected part of a body that needs to be cut the court said there was no scope of reformation for them and hence rejected their plea to take a lenient view while deciding their punishment If a part of body is too infected to be cured and spreads the disease in other parts it is always better to detach that infected part Antecedents of convicts in this case are evident that they are in habit of extorting hard earned money of other citizens with no hesitation to spill blood Such criminals do not deserve to remain in the mainstream of society as its integral part said the court In its order the court noted that the menace of the biker gang was evident in 2008 as every other day news reports of dacoity robbery and murder by this gang were published Even as the convicts pleaded that they were young and there was scope for improvement the court did not endorse their view and said True reformative theory is one of several theories of punishment which is considered to be a better theory and is in vogue in many countries particularly in democratic ones Experience shows that this theory did not yield desired result in every case specifically when the offender has become a hardened criminal The court also pointed out that the convicts were involved in several other criminal cases Police has submitted a list of the cases in which accused in this case are involves There are at least 15 cases against Om Shiv Accused Zakir is involved in 9 cases including murder and robbery Accused Israel is involved in at least 10 cases including murder and robbery said the court Commenting on the gravity of the crime the court said the convicts fired gunshots at the complainant when he refused to give his money and they again fired at a witness who tried to apprehend them New Delhi Lambasting Delhi Police for not taking steps to identify accused in a case where a minor girl was gang raped by six cops last year a trial court has directed the police commissioner to look into the probe I find that the investigating officer has not taken steps in regard to identification of police officers at police post police station concerned on the date of the incident said additional chief metropolitan magistrate Manish Yaduvanshi The court said though the FIR was registered in the case for the offence of rape none of the accused were chargesheeted under this provision In order to have investigation directed in right earnest and to rule out any possibility of retrial reconsideration this court directs commissioner of police to inquire into the matter and forward a report to the court the ACMM said The court passed the order in a case pertaining to a minor girl from Jalpaiguri in West Bengal who was allegedly trafficked to the capital by accused Geeta Lakra 24 and Jawahar Lakra 22 As per the FIR Lakras had coerced the girl into coming to Delhi with them and handed her over to the third accused Gul Mohammed 40 to be employed at his office The girl had alleged that one day she escaped from the office and came near the JPN station which comes under I P Estate Police Station where six police personnel tied her mouth and eyes and sexually assaulted her A local handed her to Child Welfare Commission which wrote to the police commissioner asking him to register a case of rape and kidnapping The police chargesheeted Geeta and Jawahar for kidnapping and Gul Mohammed for exploiting a child employee and not for the offence of rape under provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act While taking cognizance of the chargesheet the court noted that though FIR was registered under section 376 IPC rape none of the three accused were chargesheeted under it even as the girl s medical test confirmed sexual assault Considering that the girl had already named a relative of Geeta Lakra as the person who raped her before she was brought to Delhi the court emphasized further investigation needed to be monitored as possibility that the chargesheeted accused could also turn out to be perpetrators of sexual assault cannot be overruled The ACMM pulled up the police for relying solely on the statement of the victim and not examining other persons to whom she had told about the incident", "dateTime": "Feb 1, 2013, 01.51AM IST"}'],

will meet Delhi lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung at 12 30 pm and formally stake claim to form the government capping a stunning debut in the just concluded elections blasting a hole in the power duopoly enjoyed by Congress and BJP Kejriwal will start his power run by scrapping the offensive symbols of VIP culture cars fitted with red beacons and screeching hooters His ministers will also stay in their regular accommodation shunning the sprawling bungalows in leafy corners in Lutyens Delhi This will be followed by early action on providing 700 litres of water to all households and an audit of power companies whom he transformed into symbols of his fight for the aam aadmi However while these are predictable given that AAP rode to power on the strength of these populist planks the party has to contend with a major problem While Kejriwal the sole piece of heavy artillery in its armoury is the natural choice for chief ministership he is torn between his immediate responsibilities and future goal of expanding the footprint of AAP outside Delhi before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls We have six months in power before the LS polls but this is the time when I will also be travelling all over to campaign for the party It is a huge challenge for me but in the coming few days we will work out how this will be managed Kejriwal said With AAP set to take office the change of guard will be a political statement with the swearing in ceremony expected to take place at either Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan a far cry from the cloistered confines of Delhi s Raj Bhavan Kejriwal is set to be Delhi s youngest chief minister to date at 45 The swearing in ceremony is expected to include a stopover at Rajghat to honour Mahatma Gandhi Immediately after that AAP intends to press on with its agenda We have no intention of going to any party for assistance If Congress withdraws support at any time we will go back to the people and ask for a re election However till the time AAP is in power we will try and implement as many of our promises as is possible Kejriwal told TOI Just as the Delhi bureaucracy waits with some apprehension to the relatively unknown quantities set to take office the Cabinet will include rank outsiders with no political experience whether it is Kejriwal s close aide Manish Sisodia or Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti It remains to be seen how AAP manages traditional concerns like adequate representations for communities and weaker sections One concession to being in power will be Kejriwal moving from his Ghaziabad residence to a government house AAP had scheduled 280 meetings across the city between Friday and Sunday of which 128 were held over the first two days In these the party received support to form government in 110 while the majority in 18 was against its alliance with the Congress The party fielding several first timers and political novices won 28 seats in the Delhi assembly election coming second to BJP which won 32 seats With eight Congress MLAs agreeing to give it support the party will be able to touch the magic figure of 36 that is needed to form government Kejriwal said the 18 point letter he had written to Congress and BJP last week asking for their support on his main points of agenda was only a bid to expose the national parties true colours I wrote those letters knowing very well what their response would be The idea was to have them accept that in public and we achieved our goal Beyond this we have nothing to do with Congress or BJP he said Kejriwal s statement will stand to test once the Lokpal bill is passed and as promised AAP will launch an inquiry into the Commonwealth Games scam among other things which could directly impact several Congress bigwigs The party will be holding a meeting on Monday morning where it will also probably decide its future ministers While there were no official declarations certain names were doing rounds on Sunday that included an obvious choice of senior party member and close confidant of Kejriwal Manish Sisodia Others included former councilor and winner from Laxmi Nagar Vinod Kumar Binny and laywer from Malviya Nagar Somnath Bharti The party has several political novices and there were doubts about whether they would be included in the cabinet The Jan Lokpal bill first on the party s agenda if it won the elections has been postponed till the beginning of January due to the delay in AAP staking claim to government formation Kejriwal said that swaraj so far only conceptual in nature would be properly defined and implemented The idea of mohalla sabhas is something we would like to structure properly and put in place as soon as possible People cannot take all decisions but at least those pertaining to their areas can be decided by them he said An audit of discoms in an effort to reduce power bills and provision of 700 litres of free water to each family are other important issues that the party intends to tackle in the coming

took to crime and a few years later ran away from home after cops turned the heat on him In July last year Munni began receiving calls from Shankar a key player in the inter state trafficking racket

then that Shankar introduced Laxmi to Munni Laxmi told her that she was young and can get married to someone in the capital said Sharma It was then that Munni accompanied Shankar to Laxmi s residence at Uttam Nagar in August last year Laxmi tried to send the children to madrassas and hostels in the capital but managed to impress on Munni that only marriage can bring her financial stability It was at this stage that Saroj sprung into the picture in a carefully planned script Saroj said she would marry her off to her cousin in Rajasthan She claimed her cousin s wife had passed away and he too had children of his own Saroj and Laxmi coaxed Munni to hand over her children to them in Delhi They argued once she convinced her new husband she can always stay with her children said DCP Sharma The

"contents": "Investigators were struggling to find clues to the identity of the perpetrators of Wednesday s serial blasts in Mumbai raising the scary possibility that the fresh outrage may join the list of unsolved terror cases Sources familiar with the probe acknowledged that the investigators have not yet found any lead worth mentioning Although Indian Mujahideen the ISI sponsored proxy of Lashkar is seen as a possible suspect the evidence is so thin that agencies in Mumbai and New Delhi are wary of sticking their necks out var adSkipCounter 0 Wednesday s blasts were similar to the pattern seen in the attacks that were deemed to have been engineered by Indian Mujahideen The three blasts were set off using improvised explosive devices in crowded areas with a view to maximizing casualties a signature style of IM terrorists But there were major departures from the IM modus operandi as well The attacks have not been followed by electronic pamphlets taking credit for the blasts Starting with the serial blasts in UP courts in 2007 several terror attacks involving the Mujahideen were followed by emails justifying the killings as acts of courage meant to avenge alleged atrocities on Muslims Apart from the brazen attempt at communal polarization and to portray the terrorists as saviours of Indian Muslims the emails were designed to serve another purpose to keep up the fiction that the anti India terror was indigenous Investigators are baffled by the departure from the pattern first seen after the blast in Pune s German Bakery in February 2010 as they worry whether 13 7 will be another addition to the growing list of cases which remain to be worked out The Maharashtra ATS s claim of having worked out the bakery blast case has not convinced many despite one arrest and chargesheet against six other accused Three other cases of urban terror in 2010 the shootout near Jama Masjid Delhi bombs found at Bangalore s Chinnaswamy Stadium and the explosion at the Dashashwamedh Ghat in Varanasi have not been worked out so far The explosion outside the Delhi High Court this year has also not been solved In all such instances terrorists have used diverse methods For instance Indian Mujahideen sent emails owning up to the Jama Masjid shootout and Varanasi blast claiming that they were retaliation for the Batla House encounter of Indian Mujahideen operatives and Babri Masjid demolition respectively The explosive devices planted at Chinnaswamy Stadium hours before an IPL cricket match were not lethal suggesting that the terrorists responsible were seeking to score a propaganda point and cause scare In contrast the explosives used at the Dashaswamedh Ghat could have claimed a higher toll The throng that had turned up for the evening aarti was lucky because of the ineptitude of the bomber who planted the device at a place which minimized rather than maximized the impact of the blast The bombers who attacked Mumbai on Wednesday chose devices of different intensity The IEDs used at Zaveri Bazar and Dadar were more lethal than the one at Opera House As a matter of fact the toll could have been much higher but for the fact that the impact was buffered by the heavy crowd at the two busy places Investigators who were earlier able to work out some of the serious cases by listening in to the excited jehadi chatter in the aftermath of terror attacks are struck by the complete radio silence after Wednesday s attack on Mumbai The absence of emails IM s calling card till 2008 is also seen as a switch of tactic devised to dodge the investigators Moreover the terrorists have settled for plots which are modest in nature and can be implemented swiftly reducing the time needed for preparations as well as minimizing risk It seems they have gotten smarter a senior counter terror operative told TOI as he did not rule out the possibility of investigators hitting the dead end again He also said that this is part of the catch up that the law enforcers are forced to play as they fight a shadowy enemy who has the advantage of choosing the target weapon and time of attack But the challenge for the agencies also indicates the risk that cities potentially face till agencies wizen up to the terrorist s new tricks Said an intel veteran What we need is one breakthrough to unravel the whole thing He pointed out that Indian Mujahideen remained elusive for long But we worked out the Ahmedabad case and that helped us solve cases of blasts in Jaipur and Delhi leading to the elimination of the IM commander Atif Ameen at Batla House in the Capital he said", "dateTime": "Jul 15, 2011, 01.00am IST"}'],

and Gurgaon shows the hollowness of official claims about an integrated National Capital Region Buses may have been plying between these cities albeit on old routes but autorickshaws the preferred mode for many commuters and taxis except for radio taxis stay away because of jurisdictional issues and harsh penalties in the absence of any agreement Autos drop you virtually at the Noida gateway handing you over to their counterparts on the other side And the adventurous ones make a killing at the cost of the commuter It s the same story between Delhi and Gurgaon Metro has resolved this problem only to a certain extent it is in fact a boon for daily commuters But it can hardly be as convenient as an auto or a taxi It is particularly difficult for commuters who have to catch a flight or train or even go to an inter state bus stop and vice versa var adSkipCounter 0 Officials at the Regional Transport Office of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad say the agreement to allow free flow of taxis autos and buses between Delhi and UP Haryana Rajasthan and Delhi had signed it in April 2010 was yet to be cleared It was apparently revived by the Delhi government this year In principle both Delhi and UP governments have agreed but are yet to work out the modalities Several meetings were held in Delhi over the past few months but an agreement couldn t be reached over issues such as colour code of autos installation of meters and GPS devices said VK Singh regional transport officer Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad For the past few months the Delhi transport department has been talking about giving NCR permits to 8000 Delhi autorickshaws but the scheme is far from being implemented A few months back after Supreme Court allowed Delhi to add 45 000 more autos the department had announced it was roping in private companies to run autorickshaw services in these areas along the lines of radio cabs with phone booking facilities and meters Private companies will be given bulk permits of 250 and 500 autorickshaws Sources said that so far 35 companies have applied for this permit and the department says it is still in process of processing the applications Transport minister Ramakant Goswami said he did not have the latest update on the issue and transport commissioner Puneet Goyal said he will have to dig out the details Delhi Traffic Police has some prepaid booths from where passengers can book autos and taxis to NCR towns A new plan is in the offing where passengers headed for NCR towns from Delhi railway stations and the airport can travel to NCR through the prepaid service Nothing concrete has been finalized but we are introducing slabs for Gurgaon Noida and Ghaziabad for prepaid fares said a senior traffic police officer Officials say things may change for the good with the constitution of a new body NCR Transport Corporation NCRTC which will monitor and implement a comprehensive public transport plan with the idea of ensuring rapid transport systems in NCR The commute is made even more harrowing by the fact that in spite of booming developments in infrastructure and real estate in Noida Greater Noida and Ghaziabad the public transport system remains archaic and road connectivity is still at an extremely nascent stage There is in fact a distinct lack of public transport options At present Ghaziabad has two Metro stations at Vaishali and Kaushambi along the Dwarka line but these are on the outskirts of the city and connectivity to the interiors is still through an unreliable network of three wheelers and privately run buses Meanwhile the extension of the Metro route up to Noida City Centre has connected some of the arterial areas but an effective inter city public transport system as well as a planned feeder transport network remains non existent both in Noida and Greater Noida In both districts the extension of the Metro line has been approved but work has been affected by numerous delays because of issues between the Delhi and UP governments Public transport as a result is completely dependent on three wheelers According to the transport department there are about 2200 Vikrams operating in the city and another 12 000 three wheelers in Ghaziabad and a total of 3 524 CNG three seater autos and 681 seven seater CNG tempos plying across the entire Gautam Budh Nagar district But there are no fixed rates for these autos and as a result commuters suffer The commuter is further inconvenienced due to problems in road connectivity that has been caused by a mismatch between the increase in number of vehicles plying between UP s NCR towns and Delhi and the speed of road construction and maintenance Three national highways cutting through Ghaziabad NH 24 NH 58 and NH 91 form the lifeline of the city s road transport system but are witness to regular traffic snarls In Gautam Buddh Nagar commuters rely heavily on the DND flyway and the Kalindi Kunj Bridge to cross Yamuna and get to Delhi A bridge parallel to the Kalindi Kunj bridge was proposed by the Noida Authority but hasn t taken off Two other bridges proposed by PWD are still awaiting clearance While a bridge parallel to DND has been proposed for the third phase of Barapullah another will connect the Loni border T point to GT Karnal Road The latter is yet to get in principle approval", "dateTime": "Jul 3, 2013, 03.25AM IST"}'],

"contents": "Aam Aadmi Party s debut was nothing like anyone had imagined The spectacular show by its members many of them faceless first timers saw them defeating not just three cabinet ministers but chief minister Sheila Dikshit herself AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal swept chief minister Sheila Dikshit off the New Delhi radar The party managed a highly impressive 27 seats and came second in 20 The party managed to capitalize on its promise to rid the city and the country of corruption For a city struggling with inflation and having to put up with a three time government that came with its share of scams AAP was the third force that many were waiting for We gave the city an alternative that it was waiting for because Congress and BJP are really like two peas in a pod Kejriwal has always said AAP not only proved most political pundits who predicted a maximum of 10 12 seats for the party during the exit polls wrong it also forced BJP and Congress to acknowledge its impact Till just about a week earlier Congress had been claiming that the contest in Delhi was only between them and BJP After the party s humiliating loss on Sunday Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi conceded that the party had to take lessons from AAP BJP which also struggled against the party to win in several constituencies reluctantly accepted AAP as a force to reckon with Looking at its final tally it s evident that AAP made a huge dent in the Congress vote though it was also responsible for forcing a hung assembly with BJP failing to get an absolute majority Its biggest victories are from JJ clusters and unauthorized colonies where massive dissatisfaction was brewing against Congress though it has drawn support from all across the city Its best performance was recorded in New Delhi where the party ended up with seven out of 10 seats Look at our performance among urban voters We had a brilliant run in Greater Kailash where the competition was between us a strong corporator from Congress and the son of the BJP s sitting MLA We also won the Malviya Nagar seat against opposition from people like Arti Mehra and Kiran Walia one a former mayor and the other a cabinet minister said party sources Prakash the party s youngest candidate from Deoli perhaps set a record of sorts by managing one of the biggest vote share for AAP with 51 646 votes Its closest rival was BJP with 34 538 The party made an almost clean sweep in rural Delhi resettlement colonies and JJ clusters We ended up winning seats like Madipur Kondli and Trilokpuri which are totally resettlement areas In key rural seats like Bijwasan and Matiala where the party did not win the margins were not too huge In the former we lost by around 2 000 votes and in the latter by around 4 000 said party sources AAP s internal surveys were looking at a clean majority based on an expected shift of the Muslim vote which did not happen to the extent needed One of the biggest upsets by AAP was dislodging of Raj Kumar Chauhan from Mangolpuri constituency Rakhi Birla AAP candidate is a completely unknown face a young journalist who fought her first election The other surprise victory was recorded in Seemapuri The candidate Dharmendra Singh contested in place of his sister Santosh Koli the original choice for the seat who died in a mysterious accident earlier this year Dharmendra who declared the lowest assets operated through the campaigning period without even a phone He won with an astounding margin of 12 000 votes Seemapuri is the karmbhoomi of Kejriwal where he formed his NGO Parivartan and started his agitation He enjoys massive goodwill in this area In fact the seats of Rohini Shalimar Bagh and Shakurbasti have also been won in part due to Kejriwal said sources Post a comment AR_1 ob text content

against the interest of students purchasing such books adds the FIR According to CBSE its affiliated schools don t exclusively need to prescribe NCERT books for classes I to VIII but have to follow the NCERT syllabus So schools are free to use to any textbooks based on the NCERT syllabus A majority of the private schools opt for privately published textbooks as they are expensive and both the publishers and schools can make a lot of money By this they deprive the students of high quality inexpensive NCERT books said media coordinator of NCERT Hemant Kumar Class I to VIII NCERT books cost Rs 18 to Rs 45 per book whereas privately published textbooks are in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 450 Class IX onwards these schools start using NCERT textbooks as the students prepare for the board

restricted to the poor and for certain select groups Having a universal health insurance to cover all citizens is one of the ideas the government is working on The modalities are being discussed said

general Chandrajit Banerjee and the Lokayukta of Delhi Justice Manmohan Sarin were among those who attended the heart conclave to deliberate on necessary actions to tackle cardiological disorders that are growing to epidemic proportions In Delhi 7 8 of the urban population is suffering from cardiac disease We are opening more super specialty hospitals to tackle the increased burden and steps are being taken to screen people for diabetes and other conditions that lead to heart diseases said Walia Trehan said that 90 of the medical equipments required for treating heart diseases are being imported There is need for developing indigenous equipment at cheaper and more affordable rates he said Shivender Mohan Singh said it was a myth that the private sector is far more expensive than the public sector since charges of government hospitals don t reflect their actual costs If you look at the last decade the bill for say a bypass surgery has gone up only incrementally compared to average inflation I would welcome a joint study to compare average costs of public and private hospitals It would be probably more cost effective for the government to give the money to patients possibly by funding a health insurance scheme and let them choose where they want to be treated he said Professor of Cardiology at AIIMS Dr Balram Bhargava said the Stanford India Biodesign a project funded by the Indian government s department of biotechnology has come up with eight different devices so far and four other products are undergoing clinical trials Justice Sarin said there was a dire need to

said Finding out where she could get hard copies of forms also proved difficult We were told there was no form for the PWD category at Rajdhani College or any other centre and that we had to come to Arts Faculty to get the form she said The EOC saw a deluge of confused students pouring in for help as they say the helpdesks outside were unable to guide them Five volunteers helped them decide on courses We got here at 9am said Ratul Arora who like many others found himself at EOC well past 1pm yet still unclear about how things worked He had been sent to the administrative block by a group of student volunteers Another batch of volunteers misinformed Manisha Kumar Rina Vishwakarma and Rakhi three visually impaired students from Uttam Nagar that they couldn t apply because they didn t have their marksheets yet From tomorrow Thursday we will run a parallel counter at EOC Today about 30 applicants came to us and their forms were filled but tomorrow we ll sell the forms as well Bipin Tiwary officer on special duty EOC said The response to decentralization is mixed even from SC ST candidates Pooja Kumar who hoped to study English honours is pleased because the new process gives her freedom to choose her college I hope to make it to Janki Devi she said But the change in process colleges will be issuing cutoff lists for SC ST candidates too from this year has prompted some others to erroneously suspect that the SC ST quota is being abolished altogether It was easier for us earlier We d just be placed in a college This year we are wondering about cutoffs a candidate Honey Kumar said New Delhi Lovelit Khatana second year student at Sri Venkateswara College drove his wheelchair all the way from Basant Gaon to South Campus to collect a DU form for his brother but had to return empty handed The counters issuing forms were on the ground floor but to reach there one had to climb a small flight of stairs from the ground floor alright but getting to them required the candidate to climb a brief flight of stairs Khatana whose both legs have been affected by polio said there was no ramp couldn t get to the counter There was no ramp there at least none that I could see he says It s not very difficult for me to get around and I can solve the problem on my own but there are many disabled students who ll be visiting the centre Facilities should have been provided for them he says Khatana said he wanted to talk to the main persons and not just the student volunteers at the helpdesks who were only helping candidates fill their OMR forms Finding him in the spot members of students unions crowded around him and created a fuss but that was not much help either I couldn t get my form but we still have time he says gamely My brother will come back tomorrow and get the form himself He wants to study science He doesn t have this problem he added", "dateTime": "Jun 6, 2013, 04.37AM IST"}'],

priorities is the promise of a thousand additional auto stands This they say will protect them being hounded out of their waiting spots and being fined for parking violations by the traffic police In

persuaded to give five minutes of his time a patrolling bike does stop by to ask how long he ll be As the traffic policemen speeds away Singh talks about the contrast between the perceived dishonesty of those auto drivers who overcharge and that of Kejriwal who has the image of a no nonsense upright honest leader I don t want auto drivers to refuse to take passengers or overcharge We will also have to conduct ourselves like Kejriwal if he comes to power says Singh who has been driving an auto since 1984 He is looking forward to the swearing in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan I will definitely try to go there he says Pal plans to take a day off and attend the function He seems hopeful of change If he is strict with auto drivers of course they will also stop refusing passengers and

certain precautions Every year fog causes a spurt in the number of accidents on Delhi roads it also causes a reduction in the average speed of traffic and commuters complain that driving on familiar roads too becomes traumatic Vehicles with headlights switched to high beam cause a lot of inconvenience Motorists must drive in low beam as high beam gets reflected back in the fog and impairs visibility Fog lights should be turned on if visibility is less than 100 metres advised joint commissioner of police traffic Satyendra Garg var adSkipCounter 0 The worst affected areas are at Vasant Kunj Nelson Mandela Marg and area around JNU India Gate NH 1 and roads within the vicinity of water bodies Commuters travelling on Mehrauli Badarpur Road Upper Ridge Road parts of Ring Road Yamuna Marginal Bandh Road and Noida Link Road have also complained of severe difficulty while driving Outskirts of the city especially those near the national highways and near farmhouses also pose a problem claimed traffic police There is heavy vehicular movement along these stretches and areas close to the river are also affected We always advise people to drive slowly and follow traffic regulations with utmost care because the onus of safety during fog lies with the drivers We deploy traffic personnel till a reasonable time which is around 11pm and advise commuters to use reflective tape on their cars to ensure roads are safe for everybody Garg said Other areas where commuters complained of difficulty in driving due to fog included parts of Lutyens Delhi Ridge Road farmhouse areas and places with less habitation But since the traffic police do not have enough manpower to deploy personnel round the clock most stretches see diminished police presence after 11pm till the wee hours of morning the period when accidents due to fog are quite common We place PCR vehicles at strategic positions with lights on and reflectors on them There are a large number of goods and commercial vehicles plying in the night after borders open up to them at 9 30 pm We deploy extra personnel to manage traffic during the wedding season but we cannot afford to do so all the time said a senior policeman Chart out your route before setting out and be in no hurry to reach your destination suggested traffic police Besides this it is best to keep your vehicles in good condition and make sure that everything is in working condition especially the headlights brakes tyres wipers radiator battery and car heating system honking occasionally is a good idea to indicate your presence on the road to other drivers keeping to the right edge of the road or the painted road markings central divider as a guide in low visibility conditions helps too keeping a high visibility jacket and torch inside your vehicle in case of emergency and wearing bright clothes if you are on a two wheeler helps as well Traffic officials also advise against listening to music eating drinking or smoking while

developers and cash strapped investors offering big discounts to dispose their assets in a slowing economy Till about six months ago discounts on new homes in the area were being offered only by developers facing oversupply But with the economic situation worsening this category of sellers has expanded to include cash strapped investors and businessmen who are keen to sell the high end apartments they had picked up some years ago The situation offers an opportune time for bargain hunters There is a lot of distress sale today both by builders and investors said Samarjit Singh

buyers as the market is very slow If we get buyers we are willing to negotiate the developer who did not wish to be named said While prices have fallen across residential colonies in South Delhi the drop is the most in Defence Colony and Vasant Vihar For instance a 2 000 sq ft apartment in Defence Colony available for Rs 9 5 10 crore a year ago can now be negotiated for anything between Rs 6 5 crore and Rs 8 crore according to dealers Similarly the price of a 2 300 sq ft apartment in Vasant Vihar has dropped to Rs 10 12 crore from Rs 12 14 crore last year Inventory levels too have risen sharply According to property consultants residential areas such as Vasant Vihar Defence Colony Greater Kailash New Friends Colony Panchsheel Park and Gulmohar Park have about 3 000 unsold apartments and investors are set to add another 1 000 soon Property rates in Delhi had started rising a few years ago after the government allowed construction of a third floor The following spurt in construction pushed up inventory of homes but all of it could not be absorbed when economic slowdown took roots What also impacted prices were regulatory changes such as the ban on power of attorney sales levy of service tax this added almost 4 per cent to the cost of apartments and increase in circle rates We are waiting and watching as there is already an oversupply in certain areas said Sanjay Khanna director of Kailash Nath Projects which develops properties in south and central Delhi The slowdown has even forced some builders to abandon housing projects A developer who had borrowed heavily to buy a 800 sq yard park facing corner plot in West End for Rs 90 crore two years ago has abandoned the his apartment project and put the plot on the block after failing to find takers A South Delhi based real estate broker who did not wish to be named said the same builder would have sold the apartments even at the drawing board stage some years ago Builders in South Delhi generally enter into joint development agreements with plot owners After the construction of three individual floors one is given to the owner while the developer sells the rest in the market Knight Frank India s Zaidi said prices could drop more if the economy doesn t pick up It is really difficult to find buyers today High value properties are taking six months or more to be sold Zaidi said adding that the number of transactions in south Delhi have halved in the last six to eight months Bankers too say the slump in South Delhi s realty market is forcing distress sale There are others who are in businesses that are in perpetual demand and they are the ones lapping up properties on great discounts a banker who did not wish to be named said Some people over leveraged themselves by buy multiple
